    "content": "Lady Blue is an American detective and action-adventure television series that originally aired on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Produced by David Gerber, the show's pilot aired as a television film on April 15, 1985 before being picked up for a full series between September 15, 1985, to January 25, 1986. The show revolves around Chicago detective Katy Mahoney (Jamie Rose) and her violent methods of handling cases. The supporting cast includes Danny Aiello, Ron Dean, Diane Dorsey, Bruce A. Young, Nan Woods, and Ricardo Gutierrez. Lady Blue was criticized by several watchdog organizations as the most violent show on television with critics calling Mahoney \"Dirty Harriet\" (after Clint Eastwood's character Dirty Harry). ABC cancelled it in early 1986, partially due to the complaints about excessive violence. Critical reception to the series was primarily negative during its run and the series has not been released on DVD, Blu-ray, or an online streaming service. (Full article...)"
